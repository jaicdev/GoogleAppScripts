## Personalized Certificate Sender & Document Generator Scripts

This repository provides flexible Google Apps Scripts for automating document generation and email-based certificate distribution. These scripts simplify workflows by integrating Google Workspace apps like Sheets, Docs, Drive, and Gmail. 

---

## **Features**

### **1. Personalized Certificate Sender Script** (`sendCertificates.gs`)
- **Sheet Integration**: Fetches participant data from a Google Sheet with configurable column mappings.
- **Certificate Matching**: Matches participants to certificates stored in a Google Drive folder.
- **Customizable Emails**: Supports personalized email templates in both plain text and HTML formats.
- **Status Tracking**: Logs the status of each email sent in the Google Sheet for easy tracking.
- **Error Handling**: Skips rows with missing data and logs errors for unmatched certificates or failed email sends.

### **2. Document Generator Script** (`DocGeneration.gs`)
- **Dynamic Placeholders**: Replaces placeholders (e.g., `{{Name}}`, `{{Role}}`) in a Google Doc template with data from a Google Sheet.
- **Flexible Configurations**: Adaptable to various document types like certificates, contracts, or letters.
- **Automated File Creation**: Generates documents with unique names and stores them in a specified Google Drive folder.
- **Seamless Integration**: Fetches data directly from a Google Sheet for automated processing.

### **2. Prepare Google Sheets**

#### For Certificate Sender:
- Create a Google Sheet with the following columns (customizable in the script):
  - `Full Name`
  - `Category`
  - `Affiliation`
  - `Email`
  - `Status` (optional; created automatically if missing).

#### For Document Generator:
- Create a Google Sheet with column names matching placeholders in your template, such as:

### **3. Create Templates**

#### Certificate Sender:
- Certificates should be stored in a Google Drive folder, with filenames matching participant names (case-insensitive).

#### Document Generator:
- Design a Google Doc template with placeholders in `{{Placeholder}}` format.
- Example:
  ```
  Certificate of Achievement

  This is to certify that {{Name}} has successfully completed the role of {{Role}} on {{Date}}.
  ```
